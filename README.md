# OpenShelves
The application I developed during the 3rd year of study in order to complete my Computer Science Degree. Inspired by Goodreads, OpenShelves was developed using Java, integrating GoogleBooks API with Retrofit, making use of frameworks like Glide and ensuring data persistence with a cloud solution: Firebase Realtime Database.

- nested recyclerviews
- API calls with Retrofit
- JSON manipulation
- push notification
- login, register & changing password using Firebase
- statistics and graphs so that the user can visualise the reading progress
- managing digital bookshelves and accessing millions of books that can be added to a specific collection (Want to Read, Already Read, Currently Reading)
- inspiriation board in Discover screen where the user can browse through recommended books
- take a reader quiz and see what type of reader defines you with the posibility to retake it
- access to your digital bookshelf from a single device
- updating your reading goals and see how close you are to reaching them
- take part in annual reading challenge

The initial UI was created using the design tool Figma: https://www.figma.com/proto/7aaQl7o2MNS714ldQcs24r/ProiectPSI?node-id=1%3A2&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2
